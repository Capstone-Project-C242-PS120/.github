# ☁️ Cloud Computing 

The **Teja - Teman Jajan** application utilizes **Google Cloud** to power backend operations using **NestJS** and food analysis with **FastAPI**. The infrastructure prioritizes scalability, security, and seamless integration. Below is an overview of the architecture:

- **Source Code Management**  
  All source code is managed in **GitHub Repository** for version control and team collaboration.

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**  
  CI/CD pipelines are automated using **Cloud Build**, generating Docker images from the source code.

- **Artifact Registry**  
  Built Docker images are stored in **Artifact Registry** for secure and efficient deployments.

- **Deployment via Cloud Run**  
  - **NestJS** is deployed on **Google Cloud Run** to handle REST API requests with high performance and scalability.  
  - **FastAPI** is used for food OCR analysis to extract nutritional data from food images.

- **Cloud SQL and Cloud Storage**  
  - **Cloud SQL**: Stores application data, including user details, food information, and analysis results.  
  - **Cloud Storage**: Used for saving food images and machine learning models for OCR functionality.

- **API Communication**  
  REST API services are provided by the backend and accessed by the Android application to deliver real-time data to users.
